# Brain-Tumor-Analyzer
Brain-Tumor-Analyzer :- This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify MRI images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, No Tumor, and Pituitary. Developed with TensorFlow and Keras, the model achieves high accuracy through advanced data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning.
